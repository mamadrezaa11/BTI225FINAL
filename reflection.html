           Q1: <br>
    Resposive design is about having websites that are resposive to differeny devices in different ways but adjusting size of buttons, text size, and overal layout of the website.
    Based on my learning, a well built resposive design website can handle almost any device with different resolutions and for a good resposive design we must avoid using px in css as a first basic move towards resposive design.

    Q2: <br>
Web pages can take advantage of resposive design by using the measures to create a more user friendly website and get to target a wider audience. A well made responsive designed website is also much more attractive and easier to teh eyes of the user.

Q3: <br>
I learned how effective javascript is in web development, it is the only programming side of a website and its efficient development is important on how a website runs, a website without javascript will work but will not be as smart as 
one with javascript. I see javascript as a place to customize your webiste beyond what html and css can offer and javascript is very much useful for further customization as long as there is creativity involved.

Q4: <br>
in this course I got to learn the correct way to build an html web page, and implemented my javascript code into it while also learning how to adjust the look of the webpage through CSS. CSS rules will need extra time to them working alongside each other in harmory but they allow us to create better designs. And Javascript adds an application to the website which is useful for such cases like when we need a special input.
